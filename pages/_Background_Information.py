## ECG Background Information

'''

st.markdown('''
ECG (also known as electrocardiogram or EKG) measures electrical signals in the heart.

It can be used to help diagnose:
- Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
- A previous heart attack.
- Cause(s) of chest pain - for example, signs of blocked or narrowed heart arteries.

Traditionally, ECG machines consist of 12 'leads' that are placed in specific locations on the body. They are typically found in medical offices, hospitals, operating rooms and ambulances. Portable versions of these machines already exist in the form of Holter monitors and event monitors (external to the body, recording continuous or time-framed signals outside of a clinical setting), or as implantable loop recorders (surgically implanted for long term tracking).

More recently, technology has advanced to support the integration of single lead ECG recording into portable personal devices and smart watches. This has allowed easier tracking of diagnosed arrhythmia (such as atrial fibrillation, a long-term condition with episodes of abnormal heartbeat) or for proactive personal monitoring of heart health.

heartbeatDECODER aims to provide accessible ECG analysis to empower individuals to become informed stakeholders in their own health, and provide support to clinicians in efficiently and effectively monitoring and diagnosing ECGs.
